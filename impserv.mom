ImpServ is the Imperium file server. It accepts requests from clients, and
returns them the objects they asked for, preventing deadlocks when more than
one client wishes to access a given item at a time.
.PP
The "port=" or "-p" option allows you to specify the port name that
ImpServ should use to talk to clients. This is only useful if you wish to
run more than one ImpServ at a time on the same machine. For example, you
might have a "beginners" game and an "experienced players" game, or maybe a
"fast" game at the same time as a "normal" game.
.PP
The "nonews=" or "-n" option allows you to tell ImpServ that it should NOT
create news items. This is mainly useful for "fast" games (games with a low
ITU (time per update)).
.PP
The "clearplay=" option allows you to automatically clear out the flag in
every player that indicates that they are logged in. This will allow you to
recover after a system crash without the deity having to edit the player
records of people who were logged in when it happened. Note that this is
NOT recommended, as there will almost CERTAINLY be other problems in the data
after the crash that should be taken care of before allowing people in again.
.PP
The various "*cache=" entries allow you to enlarge (or shrink) the size
of the cache's used by Imperium to speed up access to common items that it
does not keep in RAM all the time (all player structures & the "world" state
are always kept in RAM). Imperium implements a write-through cache system, and
thus NOTHING will be written to disk (except when the files are flushed) or
read from disk again after the first reference if you increase the various
cache sizes enough (except for "incidentals" like news items or telegrams).

The defaults are as follows:

You should always stop the server by using ImpShut or sending the
server process a SIGINT signal so that it can properly flush the buffers to
disk before exiting. Using ImpShut is prefered.
.PP
If you need to work on the files and dont want ImpServ to start up from the
init scripts create a file called "nostart" in /usr/local/lib/imperium/data
and delete it when you want the server to start again.
